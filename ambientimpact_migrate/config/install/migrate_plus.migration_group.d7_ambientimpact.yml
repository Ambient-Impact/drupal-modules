    # This is the database connection to use for this migration group. Make sure
    # this is defined in settings.php or a file included by settings.php. You'll
    # get an error if this database connection isn't defined. Also note that
    # 'target' refers to the top-level database, while 'key' refers to the
    # second level, replica database. We want to use 'target', since adding our
    # Drupal 7 database risks Drupal 8 trying to write to it if it can't write
    # to the primary database. To clarify: $databases['target']['key'] in
    # settings.php
