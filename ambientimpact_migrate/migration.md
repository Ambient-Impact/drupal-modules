This document attempts to detail the process of upgrading
[ambientimpact.com](https://ambientimpact.com/) from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8.

# Overview

The [Upgrading to Drupal 8 documentation on
Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/upgrade) is recommended reading before
going any further as it explains many of the key concepts and the how and why of
upgrading/migration.

There are a few important concepts to keep in mind:

* The migration process requires you to install a separate Drupal 8 site, rather than upgrading the Drupal 7 site in place. This makes it easier to compare sites side by side and allows you to run and roll back migrations multiple times.
* Drupal core's migration process currently requires that the new site be completely empty, without any content (nodes) created before the migration is run. Attempting to run migrations after even a single node has been created manually [will cause errors](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_plus/issues/2843323). While it's theoretically possible to put together a custom workflow to migrate content into a site that already has user-created content, that's out of the scope of this document.

# Setting up

## Database

After installing a new Drupal 8 site, you'll need to add a connection to the
legacy Drupal 7 database in your settings.php:

```
// The legacy, local Drupal 7 database to migrate from.
$databases['migrate_drupal7']['default'] = [
  'database'  => '',
  'username'  => '',
  'password'  => '',
  'driver'    => 'mysql',
  'host'      => '',
  'port'      => '',
];
```

You'll have to fill in the details for your database. If you're developing
locally on Acquia DevDesktop like I did, here's what I used:

```
// The legacy, local Drupal 7 database to migrate from.
$databases['migrate_drupal7']['default'] = [
  'database'  => 'ambientimpact_drupal7_dev',
  'username'  => 'drupaluser',
  'password'  => '',
  'driver'    => 'mysql',
  'host'      => '127.0.0.1',
  'port'      => 33067,
];
```

Note the lack of a password - DevDesktop automatically sets up the
```drupaluser``` user without a password, which is fine for local development
but should *never* be done for a site accessible over the internet.

## Modules

The following core and contrib modules need to be installed:

* Drupal core's Migrate and Migrate Drupal
* [Migrate Plus](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_plus)
* [Migrate Tools](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_tools)
* [Migrate File Entities to Media Entities](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_file_to_media)

Additionally, the relevant modules from this repository need to be installed:

* Ambient.Impact - Migrate (```ambientimpact_migrate```)
* Ambient.Impact - Paragraphs migrate (```ambientimpact_paragraphs_migrate```)
* Ambient.Impact - Web migrate (```ambientimpact_web_migrate```)
* Ambient.Impact - Portfolio migrate (```ambientimpact_portfolio_migrate```)

# Migrations

The migrations are broken down into several discrete groups requiring their own
workflows. Note that commands are in the [Drush
9+](https://docs.drush.org/en/master/install/) format, i.e. with colon (```:```)
characters; most can be run in Drush 8 by replacing the colon with a dash
(```-```).

Most of these migrations require the [```ambientimpact_migrate```
module](ambientimpact_migrate) to be enabled. Before you enable it, you have to
provide the absolute path to the Drupal 7 root directory by editing the
```source_base_path: ''``` line in
[```ambientimpact_migrate/config/install/migrate_plus.migration.d7_file_ambientimpact.yml```](ambientimpact_migrate/config/install/migrate_plus.migration.d7_file_ambientimpact.yml).
Note that this path is the root of the Drupal 7 install, not containing the
```sites/<site>/files``` path. If you've already enabled the module, uninstall
it, make the edit, and then install it again. Alternatively, you can install
```ambientimpact_migrate``` and then edit the configuration manually using the
[Devel module](https://www.drupal.org/project/devel)'s Config editor.

All other migrations not listed here were handled using the migrations created
by Drupal core's upgrade process; for example, various site settings and other
basic stuff not requiring custom configuration and code.

## Drupal 7 public file entities to Drupal 8 file entities

Copy all relevant files from the Drupal 7 ```sites/<site>/files``` directory to
the Drupal 8 ```sites/<site>/files``` directory; the
```sites/<site>/files/paragraphs``` directory holds images and animated GIFs for
web snippets, and the ```sites/<site>/files/project_images``` directory holds
portfolio project image files.

Once files are copied, run the following command:

```
drush migrate:import d7_file_ambientimpact
```

## Drupal 7 taxonomy vocabularies and terms

There doesn't seem to be an out of the box way to migrate specific vocabularies,
so the following will migrate all vocabularies:

```
drush migrate:import d7_taxonomy_vocabulary
```

Then, you can import all the terms in the web tags and project categories
vocabularies:

```
drush migrate:import d7_taxonomy_term:web_tags,d7_taxonomy_term:project_categories
```

## Drupal 7 portfolio project nodes to Drupal 8 portfolio project nodes

Enable the [```ambientimpact_porfolio_migrate```
module](ambientimpact_porfolio/ambientimpact_porfolio_migrate) and then run:

```
drush migrate:import d7_node_project
```

## Drupal 7 Paragraph items to Drupal 8 Paragraph items

Install the
[```ambientimpact_paragraphs_migrate```](ambientimpact_paragraphs/ambientimpact_paragraphs_migrate)
and [```ambientimpact_media```](ambientimpact_media) modules.

Make sure to run ```d7_file_ambientimpact```.

Apply the [LoadEntity process plug-in patch for Migrate
Plus](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_plus/issues/3018849#comment-12928073).

Then, run the following:

```
drush migrate:import d7_file_entity_vimeo,d7_file_entity_youtube,d7_paragraph_animated_gifs,d7_paragraph_code,d7_paragraph_images,d7_paragraph_text,d7_paragraph_video
```

See the
[```ambientimpact_paragraphs_migrate```](ambientimpact_paragraphs/ambientimpact_paragraphs_migrate)
module for more information.

## Drupal 7 web snippet nodes to Drupal 8 web snippet nodes

Install the [```ambientimpact_web_migrate```
module](ambientimpact_web/ambientimpact_web_migrate) and then run the following:

```
drush migrate:import d7_node_web_snippet
```

## Drupal 8 public file entities to media entities

This is detailed in [the ```ambientimpact_paragraphs_migrate```
module](ambientimpact_paragraphs/ambientimpact_paragraphs_migrate/readme.md#file-field-to-media-field-migration)

## tl;dr

This is a quick and dirty reference used during development. This assumes public
files have been copied over, all modules have been enabled, and vocabularies
already exist or have been migrated.

### Migrate

Note that [Migrate Manifest](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_manifest)
could have been used to automate most of this in hindsight.

Absolutely everything:

```
drush migrate:import d7_file_ambientimpact,d7_file_entity_vimeo,d7_file_entity_youtube,d7_taxonomy_term:web_tags,d7_taxonomy_term:project_categories,d7_node_project,d7_paragraph_animated_gifs,d7_paragraph_code,d7_paragraph_images,d7_paragraph_text,d7_paragraph_video,d7_node_web_snippet

drush migrate:duplicate-file-detection d8_paragraph_animated_gifs_media_step1

drush migrate:duplicate-file-detection d8_paragraph_images_media_step1

drush migrate:import d8_paragraph_animated_gifs_media_step1,d8_paragraph_animated_gifs_media_step2,d8_paragraph_images_media_step1,d8_paragraph_images_media_step2
```

Just portfolio projects:

```
drush migrate:import d7_file_ambientimpact,d7_taxonomy_term:project_categories,d7_node_project
```

Just web snippets:

```
drush migrate:import d7_file_ambientimpact,d7_file_entity_vimeo,d7_file_entity_youtube,d7_taxonomy_term:web_tags,d7_paragraph_animated_gifs,d7_paragraph_code,d7_paragraph_images,d7_paragraph_text,d7_paragraph_video,d7_node_web_snippet

drush migrate:duplicate-file-detection d8_paragraph_animated_gifs_media_step1

drush migrate:duplicate-file-detection d8_paragraph_images_media_step1

drush migrate:import d8_paragraph_animated_gifs_media_step1,d8_paragraph_animated_gifs_media_step2,d8_paragraph_images_media_step1,d8_paragraph_images_media_step2
```

### Roll back

Absolutely everything:

```
drush migrate:rollback d8_paragraph_animated_gifs_media_step2,d8_paragraph_animated_gifs_media_step1,d8_paragraph_images_media_step2,d8_paragraph_images_media_step1,d7_node_web_snippet,d7_paragraph_animated_gifs,d7_paragraph_code,d7_paragraph_images,d7_paragraph_text,d7_paragraph_video,d7_node_project,d7_file_entity_vimeo,d7_file_entity_youtube,d7_file_ambientimpact,d7_taxonomy_term:web_tags,d7_taxonomy_term:project_categories
```

Just portfolio projects:

```
drush migrate:rollback d7_node_project,d7_taxonomy_term:project_categories,d7_file_ambientimpact
```

Just web snippets:

```
drush migrate:rollback d8_paragraph_animated_gifs_media_step2,d8_paragraph_animated_gifs_media_step1,d8_paragraph_images_media_step2,d8_paragraph_images_media_step1,d7_node_web_snippet,d7_paragraph_animated_gifs,d7_paragraph_code,d7_paragraph_images,d7_paragraph_text,d7_paragraph_video,d7_file_entity_vimeo,d7_file_entity_youtube,d7_file_ambientimpact,d7_taxonomy_term:web_tags
```
