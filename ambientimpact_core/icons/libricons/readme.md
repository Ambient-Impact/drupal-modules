This bundle is the [Libricons](https://github.com/ry5n/libricons) icon set, with
the following changes:

* The entire set has been run through the [IcoMoon app](https://icomoon.io/app/)
  to normalize it with other bundles, and to fix display issues related to that.

* The 'dashboard' icon is ported over from the Navbar module, as it isn't
  present in Libricons but seems to be by the same person for Drupal, under the
  MIT license.
