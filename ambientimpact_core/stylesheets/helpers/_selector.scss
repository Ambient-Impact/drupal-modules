/// Attempts to append a condition to the specified root element.
///
/// A condition is a class, attribute selector, or anything else that can be
/// added to an element selector. If the specified root element is not found in
/// the & selector, it is prepended. It's recommended to use this instead of
/// declaring 'body.condition-class' yourself, for example.
///
/// @param {List|String} $conditions
///   The classes, attributes, etc. to add to the specified root element. Each
///   list index is treated as a separate condtion. See examples.
///
/// @param {String} $target
///   The root element to search for, usually 'html' or 'body'. Compound not
///   currently supported.
///
/// @throw $target must be a simple selector and not a compound selector.
///
/// @content
///   The passed content wrapped in the modified & selector.
///
/// @todo
///   This fails badly when double nested with a selector in between the two.
///
/// @example
///   // This is the preferred way to declare root conditions, without
///   // declaring body yourself higher up the selector chain.
///   .element {
///     @include root-conditions(('.condition-class'), 'body') {
///       @include root-conditions(
///         ('.another-condition-class'), 'body'
///       ) {
///         // Content.
///       }
///     }
///   }
///   // This results in:
///   body.condition-class.another-condition-class .element {
///     // Content.
///   }
///
/// @example
///   // When passing multiple conditions as separate indices, they are output
///   // as an alternate condition, separated by a comma.
///   .element {
///     @include root-conditions(
///       ('.condition-class', '.another-condition-class'), 'body'
///     ) {
///       // Content.
///     }
///   }
///   // This results in:
///   body.condition-class .element,
///   body.another-condition-class .element {
///     // Content.
///   }
///
/// @example
///   // You can do this if you want, but it's not recommended. It's supported
///   // for cases when you don't have control over the whole selector chain.
///   body.condition-class .element {
///     @include root-conditions(
///       ('.another-condition-class'), 'body'
///     ) {
///       // Content.
///     }
///   }
///   // This results in:
///   body.condition-class.another-condition-class .element {
