// The standard curve (also referred to as “ease in out”) is the most common
// easing curve. Elements quickly accelerate and slowly decelerate between on-
// screen locations. It applies to growing and shrinking material, among other
// property changes.
$easing-standard: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1);

// Using the deceleration curve (also referred to as “ease out”) elements enter
// the screen at full velocity and slowly decelerate to a resting point.
$easing-decelerate: cubic-bezier(0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1);

// Using the acceleration curve (also referred to as “ease in”) elements leave
// the screen at full velocity. They do not decelerate when off-screen.
$easing-accelerate: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 1, 1);

// Using the sharp curve (also referred to as “ease in out”) elements quickly
// accelerate and decelerate. It is used by exiting elements that may return to
// the screen at any time.
$easing-sharp:    cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.6, 1);


// Rather than using a single duration for all animations, adjust each duration
// to accommodate the distance travelled, an element's velocity, and surface
// changes.

// Mobile
// ------
// Transitions on mobile typically occur over 300ms, within this margin of
// variance:

// * Large, complex, full-screen transitions may have longer durations,
//   occurring over 375ms
// * Elements entering the screen occur over 225ms
// * Elements leaving the screen occur over 195ms

// Transitions that exceed 400ms may feel too slow.

// Larger screens
// --------------
// Elements travelling longer distances on larger screens have higher peak
// velocities than those going shorter distances over the same time period.
// Larger screens should have longer durations so that movements aren't too
// fast.

// Tablets
// -------
// Durations on tablet should be about 30% longer than on mobile. For example, a
// 300ms mobile duration would increase to 390ms on tablet.

// Wearables
// ---------
// Durations on wearables should be about 30% shorter than those on mobile. For
// example, a 300ms mobile duration would be 210ms on wearables.

// Larger than average mobile screen size, 30% longer.
$duration-multiplier-max: 1.3;

// The minimum multiplier, for really small screens, 30% shorter.
$duration-multiplier-min: 0.7;
