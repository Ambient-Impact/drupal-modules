This respository contains Drupal modules that provide a framework for back-end
and front-end development which includes many PHP, JavaScript, and Sass
utilities, UX improvements and widgets, base styles, and libraries; for more
information, see [the component system
explainer](component_explainer.md).
These are used across multiple sites, including
[ambientimpact.com](https://ambientimpact.com/).

While not required for these modules to operate, the
[```ambientimpact_base```](https://gitlab.com/Ambient.Impact/drupal-themes)
theme integrates heavily with these modules.
